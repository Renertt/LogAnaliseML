### Description

My first project in the field of machine learning. Its goal is to develop a model that can predict the value of a house based on its characteristics.

The project is based on data from the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

### Technology stack

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:**
    *   Pandas - for proccessing data
    *   Scikit-learn - to buildштп RandomForest-model
    *   Xgboost - for building XGB-model
    *   Lightgbm - for building LGB-model
    *   Papermill - for one-file-running

### MAE

Current best MAE: 16,940.88 dollars
Current best MAPE: 9.34 %

### Total

9.34% MAPE became the best result that I can do here without full code refactor. I will try advancing the result starting this project again in another repo and fully refactoring its code. 
Also I will first-try using Deep Learning in the new repo.
